# scripts

This folder contains scripts I made.

## Running scripts

Usage of each script is written in the comments in the script itself. Some
scripts I assign to a hotkey *(such as `audio_switch.sh`)*, so that I can run
them easily. It's also helpful to add the scripts to path or create alias, so
you don't have to write the full path of the script.

## List
- `audio_switch.sh`: switches between audio devices.
- `definition.sh`: prints definitions of given word.

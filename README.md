# dotfiles

## Installation

You can run `install.sh` script to install packages I use
*(not every package, but only packages I want to install every time)*.

The script also copies the config files and sets up other programs I use
*(such as `zsh`)*.

## Usage

You will probably need to allow the installation script to run by running:
```bash
sudo chmod +x install.sh
```

Then you can run the script itself:
```
./install.sh
```

## Scripts

`scripts` folder contains scripts I made. Usage of each script is written in
the comments inside of each script. You can read more about the scripts in the
`README.md` file inside of the `scripts` folder.

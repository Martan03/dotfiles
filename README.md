# dotfiles

My dotfiles for configuring (almost) everything.

## Scripts

`scripts` folder contains scripts I made. Usage of each script is written in
the comments inside of each script. You can read more about the scripts in the
`README.md` file inside of the `scripts` folder.

## Packages

If you want to install packages I want to install every time *(not every*
*package I use)*, you can then use the `install.sh` script. It installs the
packages and copies the configuration files into the config directory.

You will probably need to allow the installation script to run by running:
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
```

Then you can run the script itself:
```
./install.sh
```
